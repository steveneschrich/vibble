Description: This package implements a versioned tibble also known as a temporal table. The purpose
 is to store changes to a table over time such that one can pull out data as of specific time points
 or versions. To do this, the package implements a data frame with a few extra columns in the form 
 of a "temporal table". This involves a "ValidFrom" and "ValidTo" field for the purpose. Routines are
 provided to make working with this data structure easy.
